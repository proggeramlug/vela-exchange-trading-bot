# Vela Exchange Trading bot

This bot is nothing fancy and I am very much still figuering out what works best. So far however I have had returns at around 20-30% with it.

Donations: amlug.eth 

## Run it

1. Fill in the blanks in `.env.sample` and rename to `.env`
2. Run: `node trade.js`

## Questions or Problems?

I'm using this myself, so if you have anything open an issue please so I can potentially help. :)
